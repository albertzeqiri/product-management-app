# Product Management App

A simple web application to manage products, allowing users to add, view, delete, and search products.

- **Delete Product**: Users can delete a product from the list, and the change is reflected in localStorage.
- **Search Products**: The app provides a search functionality to filter products by name or category.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be simple and responsive to ensure a good user experience.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the application, including forms and product display.
